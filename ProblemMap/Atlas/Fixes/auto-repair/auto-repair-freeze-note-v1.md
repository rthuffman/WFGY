If the Auto Repair README explains **what the package is**, this freeze note explains **what is now stable enough to treat as formally established in v1**. 🧭

Its purpose is simple:

> declare what is now stable enough to treat as the first formal Auto Repair package,  
> clarify what remains intentionally early-stage,  
> and define how future work should proceed without silently rewriting the current structure

This document should be treated as a **freeze boundary note**, not as a claim that the whole repair universe is complete.

3. [WFGY 3.0 Deeper Continuation Quickstart v1](./wfgy-3-0-deeper-continuation-quickstart-v1.md)

Short version:

> the first package is now stable enough to freeze  
> but future work still grows in patch mode, not by pretending the executor is finished ✨

---

## 1. Official freeze statement

**Auto Repair v1 is now considered formally established as the first controlled repair package inside Problem Map 3.0 Troubleshooting Atlas.**

This means the package is no longer in the stage of:

- scattered design fragments
- undefined architecture
- unclear layer boundaries
- missing planner or validation logic
- missing bridge to deeper continuation

It is now in the stage of:

- frozen first-package structure
- patchable refinement
- demo growth
- deeper continuation alignment
- future constrained execution planning

This is the correct reading of the current state.

---

## 2. Freeze quick map 🗂️

| Freeze area | Current reading |
|---|---|
| package role | stable enough to freeze |
| workflow shape | stable enough to freeze |
| planner contract | stable enough to freeze |
| validation and rollback discipline | stable enough to freeze |
| early semi-auto scope boundary | stable enough to freeze |
| WFGY bridge role | stable enough to freeze |
| full executor maturity | still future work |
| benchmark-scale validation coverage | still future work |
| broad family parity | still future work |

This page is the right place when the question is **how mature Auto Repair v1 really is**, not just how the architecture works.

---

## 3. What is now frozen

The following should now be treated as frozen enough for v1.

### 3.1 Frozen package role

Auto Repair is frozen as:

> the first controlled repair layer that sits between Atlas diagnosis and deeper WFGY 3.0 continuation

This role should not be silently redefined.

### 3.2 Frozen workflow shape

The basic workflow is frozen as:

```text
case
→ Atlas routing
→ fix surface
→ repair planner
→ candidate action
→ validation
→ {accept / revise / rollback / escalate}
→ optional WFGY 3.0 continuation
````

This workflow is now stable enough to act as the core operational grammar of Auto Repair v1.

### 3.3 Frozen layer stack

The following layer stack is frozen in v1:

* core structure layer
* planner and scope layer
* tiny evidence layer
* tiny demo layer
* Atlas-to-WFGY bridge layer
* worked escalation layer

This means the package is no longer only architecture plus future ideas.
It now has a usable first complete layer stack.

### 3.4 Frozen planning contract

The following are now frozen enough as the first repair-planning contract:

* repair planner spec
* repair planner prompt
* repair plan schema
* first action selection logic
* validation-aware planning
* rollback-aware planning
* escalation-aware planning

This does not mean the planner is final.
It means the planner contract is now stable enough to build on.

### 3.5 Frozen validation and rollback discipline

The following are now frozen enough as the first validation and rollback boundary:

* validation target requirement
* before and after discipline
* accept, revise, rollback, or escalate outcome set
* restore-point requirement
* rollback-aware repair logic

This is one of the most important package milestones.

### 3.6 Frozen early semi-auto scope boundary

The current boundary for safe early semi-auto use is frozen enough in v1.

This includes:

* safe early family preference
* local, inspectable, reversible, validation-ready action logic
* explicit caution around F6-heavy intervention
* no claim of broad autonomous repair

This is a major stability boundary and should not be weakened casually.

### 3.7 Frozen WFGY bridge role

The role of WFGY 3.0 is now frozen enough in the package architecture.

The correct relationship is:

* Atlas routes the case
* Auto Repair handles the first controlled move
* WFGY 3.0 continues when local repair is insufficient

This role split is now explicit and should not be blurred.

---

## 4. What this freeze does not claim

This freeze note does **not** claim:

* that fully autonomous repair is solved
* that broad semi-auto repair is already safe
* that all families are equally ready for Auto Repair
* that the action library is mature across all regions
* that executor logic already exists in a production-grade form
* that WFGY 3.0 continuation is automated
* that benchmark-scale repair evaluation is complete
* that patching is no longer needed

This freeze note only claims:

> the first formal Auto Repair package now exists,
> its core role and internal structure are stable enough to freeze,
> and future work should proceed by disciplined patching and growth rather than silent redesign

---

## 5. What is intentionally still early-stage

The following areas remain intentionally early-stage.

### 5.1 Executor layer

There is not yet a production-grade executor layer.

Current state:

* planner exists
* action shelf exists
* tiny demos exist

But broad execution logic remains future work.

### 5.2 Large action library

The package has an initial safe early action shelf, especially for:

* F1
* F4
* F7

But it does not yet have a broad mature action library across all families.

### 5.3 Benchmark-scale evidence

The package has tiny examples, worked escalation cases, and structured demos.

But it does not yet have benchmark-scale repair validation coverage.

### 5.4 Deep WFGY continuation templates

The bridge to WFGY 3.0 is now explicit.

But standardized deeper-continuation packs, notebook flows, and broader continuation recipes remain future growth areas.

### 5.5 Broad family parity

The package currently has stronger early maturity in:

* F1
* F4
* F7
* cautious F5 support

This is acceptable for v1.
It should not be misread as final family parity.

---

## 6. Why freeze now is justified

Freezing now is justified because the package already has all of the following:

* a stable architectural role
* a stable planner boundary
* a stable validation boundary
* a stable rollback boundary
* a stable early semi-auto scope boundary
* a visible action shelf
* tiny evidence packs
* tiny demo packs
* explicit Atlas-to-WFGY bridge logic
* worked escalation examples

This means the package has crossed the threshold from:

* concept cluster

into:

* first formal subsystem

That is exactly the right moment for a freeze note.

---

## 7. What future work should do

Future work should now proceed as disciplined extension rather than core re-argument.

Recommended directions include:

### 7.1 Patch and thicken

Add stronger action shelves, example packs, and worked escalation cases.

### 7.2 Expand demos

Move from tiny markdown demos toward replay, JSON, and notebook-oriented flows.

### 7.3 Improve continuation guidance

Make WFGY 3.0 deeper continuation easier for normal users and AI systems to apply.

### 7.4 Define executor boundary

Clarify what a future constrained executor layer may look like without pretending it already exists.

### 7.5 Add stronger review and regression logic

Strengthen planner review, demo review, and future patch stability checks.

---

## 8. What future work should not do

Future work should **not** do the following:

### 8.1 Silent rewrite

Do not silently reinterpret Auto Repair as a different kind of system.

### 8.2 Overclaim execution maturity

Do not turn tiny demos or planner outputs into fake proof of autonomous repair.

### 8.3 Blur layer boundaries

Do not flatten Atlas, Auto Repair, and WFGY 3.0 into one vague object.

### 8.4 Push unsafe family regions too early

Do not treat high-risk F6-heavy intervention as if it were already a safe early semi-auto region.

### 8.5 Confuse patch growth with instability

Do not treat patching as proof that the package failed to stabilize.
Patch growth is the normal next stage after a healthy first freeze.

---

## 9. Correct maturity reading

The correct maturity reading is:

> the first Auto Repair package is complete enough to freeze as v1,
> but its current maturity is that of a strong controlled foundation, not a finished autonomous executor

That sentence is the safest and strongest reading.

Not:

* Auto Repair is still vague
* Auto Repair is only future work
* Auto Repair is already solved

The truth is between those extremes, and that truth is now explicit.

---

## 10. Official freeze wording

The best official wording is:

> Auto Repair v1 is now frozen as the first controlled repair package inside Problem Map 3.0 Troubleshooting Atlas.
> Its architecture, planner contract, validation and rollback discipline, early semi-auto scope, tiny demo layer, and WFGY 3.0 bridge are now stable enough for formal use.
> Future work should proceed in patch mode and disciplined extension, not by silent redesign.

This wording is strong, accurate, and reusable.

---

## 11. Operational interpretation

Operationally, this freeze means:

* the package can now be handed to new working windows
* the package can now be used as a training and alignment reference
* the package can now support product-facing explanation
* the package can now support future patch growth
* disagreements should be handled by patch logic, not by restart-from-zero logic

That is the practical meaning of this freeze.

---

## 12. Relationship to the official WFGY continuation asset 🌊

The official deeper continuation asset remains:

* [WFGY 3.0 Singularity Demo TXT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onestardao/WFGY/refs/heads/main/TensionUniverse/WFGY-3.0_Singularity-Demo_AutoBoot_SHA256-Verifiable.txt)

This freeze note confirms that this asset is not external decoration.

It is part of the package architecture as the deeper continuation layer when local repair is insufficient.

---

## 13. Short freeze note

Below is the shortest reusable freeze version.

---

Auto Repair v1 is now formally frozen as the first controlled repair package inside Problem Map 3.0 Troubleshooting Atlas.

The following are now stable enough to freeze:

* package role
* workflow shape
* planner contract
* validation and rollback discipline
* early semi-auto scope
* first safe action shelf
* tiny evidence and demo layer
* Atlas-to-WFGY 3.0 bridge

This freeze does **not** claim that autonomous repair is complete.

It claims that the first formal package now exists and should be extended through patch logic rather than silent redesign.

---

## 14. Final interpretation

The correct final interpretation is:

> Auto Repair v1 has crossed the line from design cluster to formal subsystem

That is why a freeze note is justified now.
